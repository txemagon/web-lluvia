/* A magnitude can be expressed in multiple units (meters, feet, etc). It also has different ways of being pronounced dependending 
on the language (internationalization) and place (localization). 

  Maybe, ther is a good idea to hava a canonical (SI) unit for each magnitude.

  Some units may vary with the time (money)
